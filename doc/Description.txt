The XMacro package contains two simple, C programs (xmacrorec and xmacroplay) for recording and replaying keyboard and mouse events on an X server. This functionality is achieved through the XTest extension. (BTW it would be better to use the XTrap extension but it's not widespread in precompiled X servers...) The programs are heavily based on the xremote utility of Jan Ekholm (chakie at infa.abo.fi).

The program is modified by mailto:qball@sarine.nl[Qball Cow <Qball@Sarine.nl>] for use in an automated regression test. So it has some specialised functionality f.e. the Screenshot command.
